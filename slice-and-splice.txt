//Use spread operators with slice to return an array.
//First spread operator uses the slice method to only give the portion of arr2 from index 0 to ‘n.’
//Second spread operator passes all elements from arr1.
//Third spread operator uses the slice method to return all elements starting at index ‘n’ to the end of the array.
